# project-proposal
hw 10

Our project proposal idea is the creation of an arduino robot who moves, draws on post-its, and tries to stick them onto objects/humans depending on external stimulus. 

## Summary

Here, write a few paragraphs (half a page?) or so describing the goals of your project. Include a discussion how it will be interactive or responsive to the environment.

The goal of the project is to have our robot move around the environment and draw in response to the stimulus on post-it notes. We are inspired by the Art Robot, the Robotic Alarm that runs around, and our love for annoying reminders on post-its. Specifically, our robot should accomplish the following objectives:
  1) Respond to environmental stimulus of ___ using a ___ sensor
  2) Tosses/catapults the crumpled paper (launched and controlled by the user)
  3)

Now you can get the attention of your pesky child, lover, roommate and show them how you feel!

## Component Parts

From what pieces will you build your project? Will you build or buy those pieces?

- Placeholder (either 3D print one or buy one from Staples)
- Tweezer-like claw (would buy non-pointing clipping component that lifts the sticky note from the surface)
- servo

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use, and a block diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

## Challenges

A brief discussion of what you anticipate will be the hardest and most time-consuming parts.
 1) tearing up a first post-it from the stack requires a lot of precision from the claw
    -> alternative is to use 5x5 pieces of paper and use a mini-plunger 
 2) 
 

## Timeline

What parts of the project do you anticipate you will complete in each of the next 5 weeks? Your goal is to solve the scary problems as quickly as possible! 

- Week 1: Write proposal
- Week 2: Gather all components and complete block diagrams
- Week 3: Assembly
- Week 4: Troubleshoot
- Week 5: Present!
